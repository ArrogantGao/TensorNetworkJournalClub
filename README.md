# Tensor Network Journal Club

Welcome to the Tensor Network Journal Club repository! This is a collaborative space dedicated to discussing and sharing insights about numerical methods in tensor network theory.

Each week, a new folder is created with the corresponding date, containing an `articles.md` file where members can contribute articles and discussions.

For each article you want to share, please include:
- Title of the paper
- Link to the publication/preprint
- A short summary of the main ideas
- Key results and relevant figures (optional)

We encourage active participation - feel free to add your thoughts and comments directly in the `articles.md` file under each article's section.
