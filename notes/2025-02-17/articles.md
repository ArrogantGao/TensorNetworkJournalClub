## Identifying hard native instances for the maximum independent set problem on neutral atoms quantum processors (Xuanzhao)

Link: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04291](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04291)

Short summary: This work discuss the difficulty of solve the maximum independent set problem on unit desk graphs via classical branching method and quantum computing. The results on classical problem are more detailed, as shown by the following figure.

## Tensor Networks and their use for Lattice Gauge Theories (Xuanzhao)

Link: [https://pos.sissa.it/334/022/pdf](https://pos.sissa.it/334/022/pdf)

Short summary: Just surprised by the fact that currently tensor network is also used by the high energy physics community. The MPS tools are used to study the lattice gauge theories, no sign problem is found for the MPS tools compared with the Monte Carlo method.
